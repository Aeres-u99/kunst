# kunst
```kunst``` is a deamon that extracts the album art from the songs playing in ```mpd``` and displays them in the a little window. It doesn't loop on a timer, instead it waits for ```mpd``` to send a ```player``` event. When it receives a ```player``` event, it wakes up and extracts the album art of the current playing track. This maks ```kunst```really lightweight and makes it idle at ```~0%``` CPU usage. If a track that is currently playing does not have an embedded album art, an image of a msuic note will be shown.
 

Note: ```kunst``` is meant to be used with files that have embedded album art
